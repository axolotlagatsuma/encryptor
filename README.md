## About

This is a math project given by one of my teachers. It's about encryption and decryption of messages. The project will be a GUI application that allows the user to visualize different sorting algorithms. The user can select the algorithm they want to visualize and the app will show the steps of the algorithm in action.

### Built With
- Love

## Getting Started
### Usage
To use the app simply clone the repository then run the `app.py` file with the correct options. An example would be :

Encryption
```
python app.py -s source.txt -e encrypted.txt -a axooencrypt -m encrypt
```
Decryption
```
python app.py -s encrypted.txt -e decrypted.txt -a axooencrypt -m decrypt
```
#### Options
- `-s` or `--source` : The source file to be encrypted/decrypted.
- `-o` or `--output` : The file to be created after encryption/decryption.
- `-a` or `--algorithm` : The algorithm to be used for encryption/decryption. The default is `axooencrypt`.
- `-m` or `--mode` : The mode to be used for encryption/decryption. The default is `encrypt`.
## Roadmap

- [x] Graphical User Interface
